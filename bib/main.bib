abstractNote = {This patent describes a method of recognizing a pattern in a test object. The method consists of: specifying properties characteristic of the pattern; specifying discrete ranges of values of the properties; measuring the values of the properties in the test object; arranging the measured values in at least one test histogram; determining a reference set of values of the properties and arranging the set as at least a first reference histogram; and comparing the test and reference histograms by determination of the value of a function which provides a measure of the amount of information necessary to express the at least one test histogram in terms of the optimum code for describing at least the first reference histogram.},
